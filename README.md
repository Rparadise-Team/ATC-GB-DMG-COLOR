Rparadise presents ATC DMG COLOR, a highly personalized version of the Koriki system so that you have an experience as close as possible to having a GAME BOY / GAME BOY COLOR in your hands.

Some original Koriki applications have been maintained, such as:

- Boot Video Selector (to be able to choose the boot video when starting the console).
- Commander (file explorer).
- FTP (to transfer files between the console and a computer).
- GMU (multimedia player).
- Key Tester (console button operation checker).
- Music Selector (choose background music in SimpleMenu menu).
- Screen Koriki: set Koriki's screen values.
- Screen Stock: set Miyoo's stock screen values.
- Wi-Fi.
- GB-GBC Server/Client (possibility of playing 2 consoles as if they were connected via the link cable).

## SYSTEMS

Below is the table of the systems configured in SimpleMenu with the paths where the ROMs must be placed, the extensions they must have and the emulators or cores configured in each one of them (which can be selected at ROM level by pressing `SELECT` in the ROM lists):

|System|Paths|Supported extensions|Supported emulators|
|:------|:----|:---------------------|:--------------------|
|Nintendo Game Boy|Roms/GB|gb, gz, zip, 7z|gambatte_libretro, tgbdual_libretro, DoubleCherryGB_libretro|
|Nintendo Game Boy Color|Roms/GBC|gbc, zip, 7z|gambatte_libretro, tgbdual_libretro, DoubleCherryGB_libretro|
|Nintendo Game Boy Advance|Roms/GBA|gba, zip, 7z|gpsp_plus_libretro, mgba_plus_libretro, gpsp_libretro, mgba_libretro|

## SCRAPER VIEW

Something new is the possibility of having 3 types of scrapes and being able to switch between them through an app in the "App Section" called "Scraper View".

Inside the "Roms" folder there is another one called "Imgs" that contains the 3 folders where you have to place the scrapes (cart, cover and imagemix). The scrapes must be placed in their corresponding folder, with the same name as the game and in .png format.

## OVERLAY SELECTOR

To make it more comfortable and intuitive, you can choose by system and core how to view the game screen, maintaining the aspect ratio, with an overlay on the screen or full screen.
