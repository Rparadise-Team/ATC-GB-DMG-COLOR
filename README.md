Rparadise presents ATC DMG COLOR, a highly personalized version of the Koriki system so that you have an experience as close as possible to having a GAME BOY / GAME BOY COLOR in your hands.

Only 3 systems are included, Game Boy, Game Boy Color and as an extra Game Boy Advance, so adding games from other systems will not be recognized.

Some original Koriki applications have been maintained, such as:

- Boot Video Selector (to be able to choose the boot video when starting the console).
- Commander (file explorer).
- FTP (to transfer files between the console and a computer).
- GMU (multimedia player).
- Key Tester (console button operation checker).
- Music Selector (choose background music in SimpleMenu menu).
- Screen Koriki: set Koriki's own screen values.
- Screen Stock: set the screen values ​​of the Miyoo stock system.
- Wi-Fi.
- GB-GBC Server/Client (possibility of playing 2 consoles as if they were connected via the link cable).

## SCRAPER VIEW

Something new is the possibility of having 3 types of scrapers (box, cartridge and imagemix) and being able to switch between them through an App in the options menu called "Scraper View". The scraps must be placed in their corresponding folder, with the same name as the game and in .png format.

Inside the "Roms" folder there is another one called "Imgs" which in turn contains the 3 folders where you can place the scraps (cart, cover and imagemix).
